This code was never used in competition, never shared with anyone, never improved or bugfixed past the initial write, and never ported to C++ for the v5 brain. We have no clue why you might want to use it, but we offer this advice to you: Don't. This code should have been burned. It was written by a programmer with next to zero C experience, has very poor structuring, and could be considered spaghetti code in every sense of the word.

If, after reading this, you still want to look at this code, go ahead. I hereby release it into the public domain. Feel free to do whatever you want with it.
